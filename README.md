JavaAsteroids
=============

Using java tutorial to create an Asteroids game. Plan on modifying it for extended learning.

The Java tutorial is on YouTube through Derek Banas

Starting at lesson 50 is the code.

My goal is to take away lessons from this tutorial and create the Lunar Lander game from the 80s.
